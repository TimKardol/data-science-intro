In fact, a Jupyter Notebook itself is one big JSON file with both code and output defined. You can do whatever you want with that JSON structure. There's a few plugins that allow you to separate code and output. There's even a plugin that allows you to write your scripts in a separate file and then run them as a code cell.\n",
