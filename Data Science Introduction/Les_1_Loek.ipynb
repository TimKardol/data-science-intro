    "# Lesson 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you'll get introduced to Python, a very powerful scripting language. It's the most prevalent language in data science, which is why you'll use it this semester. As with any programming/scripting language, Python has a few quirky and a few \"yes, please!\" features.\n",

    "## Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that I'll be using Jupyter Notebooks to teach you. All of this code works perfectly fine if you export it to a Python script (xxx.py file). In fact, a Jupyter Notebook itself is one big JSON file with both code and output defined. You can do whatever you want with that JSON structure. There's a few plugins that allow you to separate code and output. There's even a plugin that allows you to write your scripts in a separate file and then run them as a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one big catch when using a Jupyter Notebook: all state is persistent. That means that variables defined in cell 1 will carry over to cell 150,000. It also means that if you overwrite a variable that is defined in cell 1 in cell 3, the rest of the notebook will run with the value of that variable from cell 3. Pretty much every \"huh, what, how?\" in Jupyter Notebook is caused by the persistent state. To solve this, you can restart the kernel and run the entire notebook again. You can also write better code. The latter option is preferred as the first one is just fighting symptoms of bad programming. This is especially true in a notebook, where it's very easy to write up a big garbled mess of interdepending code that is hard to debug.\n",
